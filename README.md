###Talk outline

#### Description
We will discuss how the Python stdlib can perform a lot of data analysis without any (great but) complicated libraries like pandas. I used to work as an analyst and getting our company's data into the Jupyter notebook was a big change for us. We didn't use any library to analyse it: sticking to the python core worked very well for us.  The talk will mostly consist of demonstrations of basic analysis . Most of the stuff we will go through should be familiar to most people, and putting it all together we will create a powerful toolset.

#### Objective
Learning some basic python that when put together becomes a toolbox for data analysis. Hopefully attenders might find out they can use this idea on their on data, or just generally write a little nicer Python code.

#### Abstract


#### Outline
*   **Background** (3 min) - What my company analysts knew and used, how using python changed the way we worked.
*   **Short discussion of the data and PrintableList** (1 min) - PrintableList creates an HTML representation of a list in the Jupyter notebook. The data will just be a list of objects with properties. 
*   **Filtering and Counting** (5 min) 
*   **Sets** (5 min)
*   **Sorting, min and max** (5 min)
*   **Grouping** (3 min)
*   **Namedtuples and loading data; Implementing PrintableList** (5 min)
*   **Conclusion**

I created a notebook with most of the things I want to mention and the actual code. You can find it here:

#### Additional notes
I used to perform a full day seminar about this subject every few months, and I think it was a success. We will try to get through it in 30 minutes, and hopefully we will :).
