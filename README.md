###Talk outline

#### Description
I will discuss how the Python stdlib can perform a lot of data analysis without using complicated libraries like pandas. I used to work as an analyst and getting the company's data into the Jupyter notebook was a big change for us. We didn't use any library to analyze it: sticking to the Python core worked very well for us.
The talk will consist mostly of demonstrations of basic analysis. Much of what I will go through should be familiar to most people, and putting it all together we will create a powerful toolset.

#### Objective
Learning some basic Python that when put together becomes a toolbox for data analysis. Hopefully attendees will find they can use this approach for their own data, or at the very least learn to write a “nicer” Python code.

#### Abstract


#### Outline
*   **Background** (3 min) - The tools with which my company’s analysts were initially familiar, and how using Python changed the way we worked.
*   **A short discussion of the data and PrintableList** (1 min) - PrintableList creates an HTML representation of a list in the Jupyter notebook. The data consist of just a list of objects with properties.
*   **Filtering and Counting** (5 min) 
*   **Sets** (5 min)
*   **Sorting, min and max** (5 min)
*   **Grouping** (3 min)
*   **Namedtuples and loading data; Implementing PrintableList** (5 min)
*   **Conclusion**

I created a notebook with most of what I expect to mention and the actual code. You can find it here: https://github.com/tomirendo/stdlib-data-analysis- /blob/master/notebook.ipynb

#### Additional notes
I used to present a full day seminar about this subject every few months, and I think it was a success. I will try to get through it in 30 minutes, and hopefully will succeed in arousing attendees’ interest and encouraging them to try this approach.
