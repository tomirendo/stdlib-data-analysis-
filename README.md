###Talk outline

#### Description
I will discuss how the Python stdlib can perform a lot of data analysis without using complicated libraries like pandas. I used to work as an analyst and getting the company's data into the Jupyter notebook was a big change for us. We didn't use any library to analyze it: sticking to the Python core worked very well for us.
The presentation will consist mostly of demonstrations of basic analysis. Much of what I will go through should be familiar to most people, but putting it together in this way creates a powerful toolset.

#### Objective
Combine some basic Python to construct as powerful toolbox for data analysis. Hopefully attendees will find they can use this approach for their own data, or at the very least learn to write “nicer” Python code.

#### Abstract
A method of combining little-known standard Python functionality to construct powerful tools without recourse to complex external libraries.

#### Outline
*   **Background** (3 min) - The tools with which my company’s analysts were initially familiar, and how using Python changed the way we worked.
*   **A short discussion of the data and PrintableList** (1 min) - PrintableList creates an HTML representation of a list in the Jupyter notebook. The data consist of just a list of objects with properties.
*   **Filtering and Counting** (5 min) 
*   **Sets** (5 min)
*   **Sorting, min and max** (5 min)
*   **Grouping** (3 min)
*   **Namedtuples and loading data; Implementing PrintableList** (5 min)
*   **Conclusion**

I created a notebook with most of what I expect to talk about and the actual code. You can find it here: https://github.com/tomirendo/stdlib-data-analysis- /blob/master/notebook.ipynb

#### Additional notes
I used to present a full day seminar about this subject every few months, and I think it was a success. Today I will try to get through it all in only 30 minutes, and hopefully will succeed in arousing attendees’ interest and encouraging them to try this approach.
